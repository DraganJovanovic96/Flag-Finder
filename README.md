# Flag-Finder
FlagFinder is a fast-paced multiplayer quiz game where two friends go head-to-head to see who can identify the most flags correctly under pressure. A flag appears on the screen, and each player has a limited amount of time to guess the country. After a set number of rounds, the player with the most correct answers wins the match.
